Welcome! I'm Angéline, a MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), very curious about the world around me and deeply passionate about diving headfirst into fascinating topics. At the moment, I am mainly focusing on AI research and especially on ensuring the fairness and trustworthiness of machine learning models. 

#### research
Since early May 2024, I am a research intern at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a visiting graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), advised by [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/). Before that, I was a student researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), where I focused on evaluating and improving cultural diversity in contrastive vision-language models with [Lucas Beyer](http://lucasb.eyer.be/), [Xiaohua Zhai](https://sites.google.com/view/xzhai), [Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin](https://ibomohsin.github.io/) and others. I was also a research assistant at the [SRI Lab](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/) with [Martin Vechev](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/martin), developing a novel evaluation paradigm for fair representation learning. Prior to this, I worked on neuro-symbolic AI at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) with [Abbas Rahimi](https://research.ibm.com/people/abbas-rahimi), where I developed a factorizer for distributed sparse block codes. 

#### other work experience
Outside of my research endeavours, I have been fortunate enough to wear many different hats and explore various industries. I developed and priced cross-asset structured products and derivatives on the trading floor at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) in London, assisted different teams in solving challenging business problems at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/ch/overview) and closely collaborated with client stakeholders at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/uk/). As a managing partner at [Founderful Campus](https://www.campus.founderful.com/), I led a team of seven students while we scouted and selected eight promising startups in which we invested CHF 25k each. During my time at ETH, I served as a teaching assistant for four different lectures, during which I prepared and taught weekly exercise sessions, held exam preparation courses and served as a liaison between professors and students.

#### scholarships
My Master's degree studies are fully funded through the [Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme (ESOP)](https://ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html) of ETH Zürich. During my Bachelor's degree studies, I was generously supported through a [Werner Siemens Fellowship](https://www.studyfoundation.ch/our-scholarships/) awarded by the [Swiss Study Foundation](https://www.studyfoundation.ch/) and the [Werner Siemens-Stiftung](https://www.wernersiemens-stiftung.ch/en/).
