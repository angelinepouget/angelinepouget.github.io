During my Bachelor thesis with [Abbas Rahimi](https://research.ibm.com/people/abbas-rahimi) and [Michael Hersche](https://iis-projects.ee.ethz.ch/index.php/User:Herschmi) at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/), I developed a sparse resonator network (the full thesis can be found [here](/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf)). The resulting [paper](https://neurosymbolic-ai-journal.com/system/files/nai-paper-713.pdf) was just accepted for publication in [Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence](https://neurosymbolic-ai-journal.com/).
