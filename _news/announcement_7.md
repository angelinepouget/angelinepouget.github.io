Very excited to share our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13777) on cultural diversity in contrastive vision-language models that I worked on while at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) with [Lucas Beyer](http://lucasb.eyer.be/), [Emanuele Bugliarello](https://e-bug.github.io/), [Xiao Wang](https://x.com/brainshawn), [Andreas Steiner](https://x.com/AndreasPSteiner), [Xiaohua Zhai](https://sites.google.com/view/xzhai) and [Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin](https://ibomohsin.github.io/).
